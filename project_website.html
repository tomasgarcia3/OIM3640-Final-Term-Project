    <h2>The Crypto Trading Bot</h2>
    <h4>Big Idea:</h4>
    <p>
      The idea behind this project was to create a crypto trading bot that would
      collect data on a crypto coin, then analyze its metrics and finally create
      a buy or sell order based on the trading strategy.
    </p>
    <h4>Goal:</h4>
    <p>
      My main goal with this project was not only to create a profitable trading
      bot, but also being able to learn more about python and improve my skills
      as well as understanding of the features and frameworks.
    </p>
    <h4>Why did I do this:</h4>
    <p>
      The main reason why I chose to build a crypto trading bot as my final
      project was because I like to keep up and invest in financial markets and
      always though how insteresting it would be to explore the possibilities of
      a trading bot. Before this experience I had never interacted with a
      trading bot so it made me realize many things about using trading bots to
      make money. On one end, I now understand the complexity that comes with
      profitable trading bots and the enormous amount of time that has to be put
      into it. I spent so much time in this project and it does not even come
      close to being completely profitable. However although I found this
      complex an challenging, I can see why many banks and financial entities
      are investing so much money into trading algorithms and bots because of
      how efficient they are to collect and process data.
    </p>

    <h2>User Instructions</h2>
    <p>
      This crypto trading bot uses 100% python. It uses the CCXT library to get
      information about ticker, used TA-LIB library for the analysis matrics,
      and Gemini Sandbox exchange to place orders.
    </p>
    <h3>Steps to follow:</h3>
    <h4>1. Get Gemini Sandbox API</h4>
    <p>
      Follow the link below to create an account and get the API with Gemini
      Sandbox.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>

        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>3. Download bot.py</h4>
    <p>Once you have installed all dependencies you can download the bot.</p>
    <h4>4. Update API with your own</h4>
    <p>Then you would need to update the api with your own public and private key. </p>
    <h4>5. Run bot with desired ticker</h4>
    <p>You can run the bot to make money/or lose. Good luck!</p>

    <h2>Implementation Information</h2>
    <h3>Bot.py is composed of 4 functions:</h3>
    <h4>1. Collects data</h4>
    <p>
      The first function uses CCXT library to collect information from ticker.
    </p>
    <div class="center">
      <img src="images/collectData.png" alt="Collect Data" />
    </div>
    <h4>2. Analyzes the data</h4>
    <p>
      Afterwards, this function take sin the data and obtains RSI which is used
      to determine if the coin should be bought based on whether it was oversold
      or overbought.
    </p>
    <div class="center">
      <img src="images/analyzeData.png" alt="Analyze Data" />
    </div>
    <h4>3. Executes trade</h4>
    <p>
      The order function would then get the recommendation and either buy, sell
      or wait based on what is recommended in the analysis.
    </p>
    <div class="center">
      <img src="images/placeOrder.png" alt="Place order" />
    </div>
    <h4>4. Putting everything together</h4>
    <p>
      Finally this function puts everything together and in the desired order.
      It will also communicate each time the type of recommendation given.Keep
      in mind that if the previous recommendation is the same it will not be
      executed again. Meaning that if the exchange bought the ticker it will not
      buy it again if the recommendation to buy is given a second time in a row.
    </p>
    <div class="center">
      <img src="images/runBot.png" alt="Run Bot" />
    </div>
    <hr />
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <h4>Waiting to place order</h4>
    <p>
      The software is running and will not place a buy or sell order unless is
      recommended by the RSI trading strategy.
    </p>
    <div class="center">
      <img src="images/waitResult.png" alt="Waiting Results" />
    </div>
    <h4>Placing a BUY order</h4>
    <p>
      Once the RSI strategy recommends to buy the ticker then the order will be
      executed and recorded.
    </p>
    <div class="center">
      <img src="images/buyResult.png" alt="Buying Results" />
    </div>
    <h4>Keeping order</h4>
    <p>
      As you can see the program recognizes a BUY order has already been
      executed and thus it will not buy more unless a SELL order is places.
    </p>
    <div class="center">
      <img src="images/unchangedResult.png" alt="Unchanged Results" />
    </div>
    <h4>Placing a SELL order</h4>
    <p>
      The program waits until the RSI trading strategy recommends to sell the
      order.
    </p>
    <div class="center">
      <img src="images/sellResult.png" alt="Selling Results" />
    </div>

    <h2>Project Evolution</h2>
    <p>
      The creation was not easy. It involved a lot of learning about using the
      different libraries and existing programs for this bot to work. I
      initially thought that it was not going to be too hard, but I was
      mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The process started by looking at different existing bots. Most were
      written in python but even others in languages like JavaScript. In this
      step, I saw many approaches that I considered taking, however, in the
      first attempts I ended up finding barriers that were very hard to pass.
      Some involved deep learning of Pandas and NumPy which I did not have.
      Others involved deep technical skills with respect to analysis and
      algorithms which I couldn't even understand. With this said, I had to
      start over many times. This is when I decided to take a more simple
      approach and use libraries to facilitate the development of this program.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once I entered the mentality of simplicity and learned about different
      libraries I was able to find the way to build this program. First of all,
      I found inspiration in the structure of this program from one of the
      resources listed below. This allowed me to figure out that the program
      could just be an integration of 4 functions in which one collects the
      data, the second analyzes the data, the third executed the order, and the
      fourth just brings the program together. Once I figured this out I began
      by collecting the data from the CCXT library. I knew the data I needed
      depended on the purpose of analysis so I also dug deeper into TA-Lib and
      determined I would use RSI as my indicator. I chose RSI because it was a
      term I knew from before and seemed relatively simple to determine when the
      crypto was overbought or oversold (The links to finding more information
      about these two libraries and the ways they can be used are below). Then I
      proceeded to incorporate the Gemini Sandbox API into the program to
      execute the order based on the buy or sell signal. For this, I also used
      the resource on their website to find more information about how to create
      this order and get information from the ticker using the API. I finally
      put everything together and got the desired result.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to say that this process was hard and I failed many times in the
      process. I took different approaches along the way to find barriers that
      would not let me continue. It was frustrating at times to have to start
      over again but I am glad I did not quit because I feel like I learned a
      lot along the way. The result was possible through a lot of investigation
      and learning found in the resources listed below. With respect to the
      profitability of my bot, I want to say that it still relies on a lot of
      luck. Even though the example above shows a profit made from buying and
      selling in some cases before and after the trade came out to a loss. So
      while I was unable to make a profitable bot, I still got all the learning
      experiences I wanted out of this assignment.
